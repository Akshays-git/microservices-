# Travel Agent Management System

A comprehensive microservices-based application for managing travel agents, bookings, sales, and invoicing. This system allows travel agencies to efficiently manage their agents' information, track bookings and commissions, record sales, process payouts, and handle train bookings with seat management.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of six integrated microservices:

1. **Agent Service** (Port 8000): Manages travel agent profiles and availability
2. **Booking Service** (Port 8001): Handles customer bookings and agent commissions
3. **Sales Service** (Port 8002): Tracks sales data and provides trend analysis
4. **Invoicing Service** (Port 8003): Processes invoices and agent payouts
5. **Train Booking Service** (Port 8084): Manages train bookings, information, and pricing
6. **Train Seat Status Service** (Port 8090): Tracks seat reservations and status

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujith27pes/makemytrip_micro.git
   cd makemytrip_micro
   ```

2. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Verify all services are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

### Testing the API

Run the provided test script to verify all endpoints are working correctly:

```bash
chmod +x test_endpoints.sh
./test_endpoints.sh
```

This will generate:
- A text report (`api_test_results.txt`)
- An HTML report (`api_test_results.html`)
- A PDF report if the required dependencies are installed

## üîÑ Service Integration

The Travel Agent Management System uses a microservices architecture with the following integration points:

- **Agent Service**: Core service for agent management
- **Booking Service**: Integrates with Agent Service to validate agents
- **Train Booking Service**: Integrates with both Agent Service and Booking Service
- **Train Seat Status Service**: Integrates with Train Booking Service
- **Sales Service**: Records sales data from bookings
- **Invoicing Service**: Processes invoices based on booking data

The services communicate via RESTful APIs using httpx, with Docker Compose providing service discovery and networking.
